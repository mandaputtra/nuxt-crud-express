# nuxt-crud-express (WIP)

> Simple basic nuxtjs CRUD with express and mongo

**Using nuxt with express and running it the same times are consider the bad practice (when you got bunch of route it will get harder to mantain). I'm done with CR thinghs here and maybe you will get it to implement UD. So feel free to implement it.**


## Setup backend

Backend things are placed on the server folder, please config the database by your database
dont forget it. thanks still onprogrees on the UI and many. will add some auth. and use env variable in nuxt.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
